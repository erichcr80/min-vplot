# min-vplot
## Minimal V-Plotter Controller

This Arduino sketch implements a simple motion controller for a v-plotter with a serial interface. It has a simple buffer system and accepts linear moves, feed instructions, and M3/M4 to control a servo for pen lifts.

## Minimal V-Plotter Sender

Command line application for sending NC programs to the controller over a serial interface. Supports either win32 / OS X.
